# ExData_Plotting2

### Introduction ###

* The objective of this ExData_Plotting course project2 is to investigate the National Emissions Inventory database and explore what do the 
database say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United States over the 10-year period 1999-2008. The data that you will use for 
this project are for 1999,2002,2005 and 2008.

* This repository is a submission for the course project. The course project has given some questions and tasks for this exploratory analysis.  

  Below is the stated questions to answer by using plotting system in R:

  1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total 
     PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
     
  2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
     Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
   
  3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources 
     have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? 
     Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
     
  4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
  
  5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
  
  6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California
     (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
